# i created a macropad a while back

I was pretty happy that the circuit board worked out first try.

![my macropad](/macro.png)

I followed ai03's guide [found here](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/page/pcb-guide-part-1---preparations) and had almost no issues once I figured out what KiCad expected from me. 

Unfortunately the firmware code is long gone. I remember I had a problem figuring out the orientation QMK expected compared to the physical layout of the board. I think I ended up transposing my code 90 degrees counter-clockwise in order for the keys to work as expected. But hey, it works. 

Also the logo AND text is upside down. Woops!
