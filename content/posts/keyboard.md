# i created a macropad a while back. 

I was pretty happy that it worked out first try.

![my macropad](/macro.png)

I followed this ai03's guide [found here](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/page/pcb-guide-part-1---preparations) and had almost no issues once I figured out what KiCad expected from me. 

Unfortunately the code is long gone.

Also the logo AND text is upside down. Woops!
