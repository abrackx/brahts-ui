# about

I was born in St. Clair Shores, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. Turns out a while ago it was home to [rumrunners and speakeasies.](https://www.candgnews.com/news/when-metro-detroit-went-dry-117049) I never experienced any of that but I do remember it being pretty cold. We moved to Florida in 2001 and I have lived in the Tampa Bay area since then.

I received a B.A. in Mathematics from the [the University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/) in 2017.

I do a lot of work on backend systems. My goal is to work with distributed systems and to design software to facilitate their use.

My current languages are Java, Javascript and Rust.
