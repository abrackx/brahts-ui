I was born in St. Clair Shores, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. Turns out a while ago it was home to [rumrunners and speakeasies](https://www.candgnews.com/news/when-metro-detroit-went-dry-117049). I never experienced any of that but I do remember it being pretty cold. My family and I moved to Florida in 2001. Since then I have lived in the Tampa Bay area.

In 2017 I received a B.A. in Mathematics from [the University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/). Shortly after I started work at [Masonite International](https://residential.masonite.com/where-to-buy/) where I built internal pricing tooling, batch process handling and product configuration services. In 2021 I began work at [Liquibase](https://hub.liquibase.com/) focusing on their Hub platform which enables developers and their teams to easily monitor database change activity in real time. 

I do a lot of work on backend systems. My primary focus is working with distributed systems and designing software to facilitate their use.

Open source software is a foundation of the modern internet. I promote it whenever possible. This website was made using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [hugo-book theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).
