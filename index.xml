To get solid, consistent prints you need to take a few extra steps after assembling:
Install a bl-touch. Set up a raspberry pi with octoprint. Connecting your printer to your pi
Turns out there&amp;rsquo;s some issue with voltages that causes some wonkiness if you just use a normal usb a to micro usb cable when connecting your printer to your pi.</description></item><item><title>keyboard</title><link>http://example.org/posts/keyboard/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 22:21:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/keyboard/</guid><description>i created a macropad a while back # I was pretty happy that the circuit board worked out first try.
I followed ai03&amp;rsquo;s guide found here and had almost no issues once I figured out what KiCad expected from me.
Unfortunately the firmware code is long gone. I remember I had a problem figuring out the orientation QMK expected compared to the physical layout of the board. I think I ended up transposing my code 90 degrees counter-clockwise in order for the keys to work as expected.</description></item><item><title>about</title><link>http://example.org/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 21:31:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/about/</guid><description>I was born in St. Clair Shores, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. Turns out a while ago it was home to rumrunners and speakeasies. I never experienced any of that but I do remember it being pretty cold. My family and I moved to Florida in 2001. Since then I have lived in the Tampa Bay area.
In 2017 I received a B.A. in Mathematics from the the University of South Florida.</description></item><item><title>contact</title><link>http://example.org/contact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 21:31:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/contact/</guid><description>reach out # Feel free to send me a message.
